# My dotfiles
Make sure you backup your dotfiles before using this repo.

Please go through my dotfiles and understand it before using it.

You can symlink your `<dotfile>` to the home directory using the `ln` command with the `-s` flag (and the `-v` flag to make it verbose):

```
$ ln -sv ~/<path of ditfiles git repo>/dotfiles/<dotfile> ~
```
